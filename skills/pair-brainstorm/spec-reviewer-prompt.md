# Spec Document Reviewer Prompt Template

Use this template when dispatching a spec document reviewer subagent. Provide precisely crafted review context — never your session history.

**Purpose:** Verify the PRP is complete, consistent, grounded in codebase reality, and ready for implementation planning.

**Dispatch after:** PRP and ADR files are written.

```
Agent tool (general-purpose):
  description: "Review PRP spec document"
  prompt: |
    You are a PRP (Product Requirements Prompt) reviewer. Verify this spec is complete,
    consistent, and ready for implementation planning.

    **PRP to review:** [PRP_FILE_PATH]
    **ADR files (if any):** [ADR_FILE_PATHS]

    ## What to Check

    | Category | What to Look For |
    |----------|------------------|
    | Completeness | TODOs, placeholders, "TBD", missing sections from PRP template |
    | Consistency | Internal contradictions, conflicting requirements |
    | Codebase Grounding | Does the Codebase Context section reference real files and patterns? Are claims about existing code verifiable? |
    | Clarity | Requirements ambiguous enough to cause someone to build the wrong thing |
    | Scope | Focused enough for a single plan — not covering multiple independent subsystems |
    | YAGNI | Unrequested features, over-engineering, unnecessary complexity |
    | Decision Capture | Are significant decisions documented with ADR links? Are ADRs present for non-obvious choices? |
    | Story Breakdown (feature PRPs) | Does a feature-level PRP include a Story Breakdown? Are stories independently plannable? Are dependencies clear? |

    ## Calibration

    **Only flag issues that would cause real problems during implementation planning.**
    A missing section, a contradiction, a claim about existing code that looks wrong,
    or a requirement so ambiguous it could be interpreted two different ways — those are issues.
    Minor wording improvements, stylistic preferences, and "sections less detailed than others" are not.

    Approve unless there are serious gaps that would lead to a flawed plan.

    ## Output Format

    ## PRP Review

    **Status:** Approved | Issues Found

    **Issues (if any):**
    - [Section X]: [specific issue] - [why it matters for planning]

    **Recommendations (advisory, do not block approval):**
    - [suggestions for improvement]
```

**Reviewer returns:** Status, Issues (if any), Recommendations.
